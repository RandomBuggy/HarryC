# 5 steps is needed by a compiler to compile a programme
1.pre-procrssing
2.compilation
3.assembly
4.linking

In pre-procrssing step,

comments are removed, macros are expended, all pre-processed files are saved into one file with necessary lines of code

pre-processed output file is *.i

In compilation step,

*.i file is converted into assembly language instructions 

compiled output file is *.s


In assembly step,

assembly code converted into binary or machine level instructions

assembled output file is *.o


In linking step,

the linker packed all *.o files into a executable file in linux just abc but in windows abc.exe. two types of linking static and dynamic.

static like *.exe

dynamic like *.dll (in windows)
