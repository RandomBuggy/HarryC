/*
 * files are used to access and store data in hard disk. in the file data and information are stored.
 * so, file can be used to reuse of data or information even a after the termination of C programme.
 *
 * so, files contains the data of non-volatile memory into the volatile memory.
 *
 * so, file is needed to store data even after termination of programme.
 *
 * the non-volatile memory (RAM) can not handle large amount of data at a time as its size is less relative to volatile memory (HDD) and also it is easy to transfer data as files.
 *
 * there are two types of files 
 *
 * 1.text files ==> stores data in plain text and can easily be read through text editor
 *
 * 2.binary files ==> more secure and stores data in the form of bit stream
 *
 * high level file operations in C, there are four operations
 *
 * 1. creating new file
 *
 * 2. opening a file
 *
 * 3. closing a file
 *
 * 4. reading from a file and writing to a file
