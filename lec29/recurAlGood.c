/*
 * In iteration each function call happens one time

 * so, In a problem that can be solved both iteratively and recursively, iterative approach makes n+1 function calls
 *
 * But In recursion single function call happens several time
 *
 * so, In a problem that can be solved both iteratively and recursively, recursion approach makes exponencial function calls
 *
 * In above mentioned such problems, the recursion method reduce code complexity but increase time complexity
 *
 * So, recursion is not always good??????
